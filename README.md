# shootchatapp
ShootChat, as the name implies is a simpler version of SnapChat and, unlike previous apps, it uses Firebase instead of Parse for its back-end. Users register in the app, choose photos to send other users who can then look at them only once, as when they hit the back button the photo is deleted. This was also the first app where I dabbed with Kotlin.  NOTE: This app was developed as a part of Rob Percival's course 'The Complete Android Oreo Developer Course'.
By building this app you can easily learn firebase and you also became friendly with kotlin
